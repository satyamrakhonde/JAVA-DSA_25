----------------ROADMAP (2 MONTHS)--------------------------------------------------



Perfect 💪 — you’re ready for a 2-month structured DSA master roadmap, designed to take you from “I can’t solve DSA questions” → “I can crack any coding interview at product-based companies.”

This plan is designed for Java developers (like you), focused on patterns + logic + interview confidence, and builds in the same sequence top mentors (like Striver / NeetCode) follow.

1 String problem

1 Tree/Graph problem

1 Logical reasoning

Platforms:
👉 LeetCode “Top 150 Interview Questions”
👉 Striver’s SDE Sheet (pick medium questions)

🧠 Tips to Stay Consistent

✅ Use a DSA Tracker Sheet (I can make one for you)
✅ Watch NeetCode / Striver explanations before solving
✅ Focus on pattern recognition, not memorization
✅ Keep notes of mistakes — revisit weekly
✅ Solve 2 easy + 1 medium daily consistently

⚙️ OUTPUT AFTER 2 MONTHS

✅ You’ll know every major DSA pattern
✅ Can solve any LeetCode medium in 20–25 mins
✅ Can think in time complexity (O(log n), O(n^2), etc.)
✅ Will be interview-ready for mid-level product companies

Would you like me to now create a Google Sheet / Notion Tracker with
✅ week-by-week checklist,
✅ LeetCode problem links,
✅ notes column & status tracker —
so you can follow it daily and mark your progress like a real bootcamp?
